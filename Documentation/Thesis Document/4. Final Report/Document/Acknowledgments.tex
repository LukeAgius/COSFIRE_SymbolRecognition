I would like to give my thanks to many people who, in one way or an other, have helped me through the completion of this degree and ultimately this dissertation.\\

I would like to first and foremost express my gratitude and appreciation to my supervisor, Dr. George Azzopardi, whose expertise, understanding, and patience, added considerably to my graduate experience. I appreciate his vast knowledge and skill in many areas and his constant assistance and advice in writing this report whilst allowing me the room to work in my own way. \\

Special thanks go to my parents for their constant support, motivation, encouragement through out my studies. Without their help, patience and perseverance I would not be where I am today.\\

I am also thankful for and would like to acknowledge many others who helped me along the way: fellow students for going through this academic journey together, colleagues for sharing ideas and my friends for their patience.\\
