\chapter{Evaluation}

I am very satisfied with the study I have carried out during this dissertation. Through out this project I have gained knowledge in the area of pattern recognition and also managed to implement a classifier around the COSFIRE descriptor whilst learning a new language enviroment, MATLAB. Previously, the COSFIRE filter was used to the detection of vascular bifurcations, recognition of handwritten digits and detection and recognition of traffic signs in complex scenes. In this study I have contributed academically by evaluating the effectiveness of COSFIRE Filters in the recognition of architectural and electrical symbols. \\

The project plan time line deviated slightly from the original plan resulting in, processing only the first three categories of datasets. However, even though I have delayed in some of the tasks, due to unpredictable circumstances, with the help of my supervisor I have approached this dissertation in a methodical way. As a result, this dissertation helped me to mature both technically and behaviourally. \\

From a technical point of view, I have broadened my technical knowledge in an area, pattern recognition, which i had no experience in. From a behavioural point of view, I have improved my writing skills by being concise but still getting the point across. All in all, I have found the research process to be stimulating and this project gave me a lot of satisfaction which encourages me to further my studies.
